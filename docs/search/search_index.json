Configuration With Landing I've tried to expose as much of the styling as possible to mkdocs, so that you can change up the theme to your own personal style as much as possible. Of course, there's nothing more flexible than writing your own css, so if you hit a wall with the config file I've also tried to make the html as simple as possible so you can easily add your own custom CSS. Click here for a full list of configuration options available. History Landing came out of me wanting to use mkdocs for my own personal landing page - I made a custom .css file to sit alongside a generic mkdocs file and style it the way I wanted it. When implementing a similar page for a friend I realised that this basic structure could be fairly easily modified with a few key parameters to match a variety of different aesthetics. Gallery Below are some implementations of Landing with various styles, as an example. Todd Parsons The configuration I've got on my own personal site - not all that different than default Landing, but note the different header layout (I made my avatar slightly bigger and changed the order via the avatar_size and layout parameters) Full page Config file Ben Ambrose A site I built for a friend - this one relies on content being in <article> tags, and got a little funky with the background_gradient parameter. Full page Config file Catppuccin example I'm a big fan of Catppuccin, so of course the first example I made was in latte/mocha! If you want a site which straight away has lovely matching colors, you can't go far wrong with catppuccin, so please feel free to steal the mkdocs.yaml file below.
